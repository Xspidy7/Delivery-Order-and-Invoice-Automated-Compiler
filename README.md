## Description


This project was done for TSH Group.

1. The main Data Extractor file is named "Data Extractor" and there are more specific details to use it inside the Excel sheet.

2. Please enable editing and enable content when you open "Data Extractor"

3. Press the button and select the the data files. The dummy data files you can use to test are named "Tax Invoice" and "Delivery Order".



 This project automates the process of extracting specific data from multiple Excel files and consolidating the information into a structured table. The JavaScript retrieves user-selected files, identifies key data points (like document numbers, dates, and order details), and adds the extracted information into a destination table within the active workbook. It handles different document formats (e.g., Delivery Orders and Tax Invoices) and processes multiple files in a single run, saving time and reducing manual effort.

Key Features:

File selection via a user-friendly file dialog.

Automated data extraction based on document type.

Robust error handling and logging for debugging.

Efficient management of Excel instances and memory.

This script demonstrates automation, data parsing, and interaction with Excel objects, showing strong practical application of JavaScript for streamlining repetitive tasks.
