# Delivery-Order-and-Invoice-Automated-Compiler
 This project automates the process of extracting specific data from multiple Excel files and consolidating the information into a structured table. The VBA script retrieves user-selected files, identifies key data points (like document numbers, dates, and order details), and adds the extracted information into a destination table within the active workbook. It handles different document formats (e.g., Delivery Orders and Tax Invoices) and processes multiple files in a single run, saving time and reducing manual effort.

Key Features:

File selection via a user-friendly file dialog.
Automated data extraction based on document type.
Robust error handling and logging for debugging.
Efficient management of Excel instances and memory.
This script demonstrates automation, data parsing, and interaction with Excel objects, showing a strong practical application of VBA for streamlining repetitive tasks.
